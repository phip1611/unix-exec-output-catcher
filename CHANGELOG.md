# 0.2.x - 0.2.4
Small bug fixes including it works now on ARM.

# 0.2.0
Breaking new release. I didn't increase the major number because my crate is so new that
no one is using it so far.
Added `OCatchStrategy` as third parameter for the public interface/function.

# 0.1.2/0.1.3
Bug fixes and readme updates.

# 0.1.1

Added a notice that `std::process::Command` already covers this and that it
is probably the better abstraction.

# 0.1.0

Initial release
